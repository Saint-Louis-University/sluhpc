## Overview

The goal of `sluhpc` is to simplify the [parallelization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing) and execution of [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) code on the [Saint Louis University](https://www.slu.edu) (SLU) [High Performance Cluster](https://apex.slu.edu) (HPC).

<br />

## Installation

You can install `sluhpc` from [GitHub](https://github.com/Saint-Louis-University/sluhpc) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("Saint-Louis-University/sluhpc")
```

<br />

## Notes

### R Version

The current version of R on the cluster is [Microsoft R Open](https://mran.microsoft.com/open) 3.3.2. You may avoid many potential errors by working in a local copy of R circa 3.3.2.

### IP Restriction

The cluster only accepts connections from [IP addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) registered to SLU. If working off campus, you will need to log into the [VPN](https://vpn.slu.edu/+CSCOE+/logon.html) using your SLU Net ID and password.

### Credentials

By default, credentials to connect to the HPC are read from the environment variables `APEX.SLU.EDU_USER` and `APEX.SLU.EDU_PASS` using [`base::Sys.getenv()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.1/topics/Sys.getenv). These variables are commonly set via a [.Renviron file](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.1/topics/Startup).

<br />

## Example

This is a three-step example which shows how to execute R code in parallel on the cluster.

### Step 1

We define a function and construct a corresponding parameter set. Then we create a local folder containing of all the files necessary to run the code in parallel on the cluster.

```{r}
library(sluhpc)

my_function <- function(parameter_mu, parameter_sd) {
  sample <- rnorm(10^6, parameter_mu, parameter_sd)
  c(sample_mu = mean(sample), sample_sd = sd(sample))
}

my_parameters <- data.frame(parameter_mu = 1:10,
                            parameter_sd = seq(0.1, 1, length.out = 10))

slurm_job <- slurm_apply(my_function, 
                         my_parameters, 
                         "my_apply")
```

### Step 2

We open a [secure shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) (SSH) connection to the cluster using credentials stored in your [.Renviron file](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.1/topics/Startup), upload the previously created local folder, and submit the job to the [Slurm Workload Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slurm_Workload_Manager).

```{r}
session <- apex_connect()
slurm_upload(session, slurm_job)
slurm_submit(session, slurm_job)
```

### Step 3

The `slurm_download()` function will block until the job has completed running on the cluster and then download the results via [SCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_copy). We can then bind the results from each node together into a data frame object, and disconnect our SSH session.

```{r}
slurm_download(session, slurm_job)
results <- slurm_output_dfr(slurm_job)
apex_disconnect(session)
```
